https://github.com/ScottLogic/openapi-forge

## various TODOs

### add support for:

    - various object inheritence types
    - non-default parameter serialisation styles

## Quick Start

Clone and then navigate to root directory of the repository.

Install all the dependencies needed:

```
npm install
```

Once you have a local version, you can reference its location as the 'generator' argument of the 'forge' command of openapi-forge.

```
$ openapi-forge forge
 \ https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
 \ {location of local generator}
 \ -o api
```

## Testing

Using the one command below you can automatically run the testing:

```
npm test
```

## Notes

The openapi-forge dependency is pointing to commit:6be3962bc263948237f71689b2df7ba73e116a55. If openapi-forge is updated and openapi-forge-csharp requires this updated version then the commit reference in package.json will have to be updated. This is a temporary measure and will be fixed once the packages are properly versioned and hosted on npm.
